Watertight Engine
==========
Introduction
------------
Watertight Engine is an Open Source project for testing ideas for a game engine.  It's built in 
C# and Lua, with OpenGL used as rendering

Building
--------
Watertight has been tested with Microsoft .NET framework 4.0.  I haven't tested it on Mono
but it should work.

All dependencies are located in the Dependencies folder.  To run the engine, you must copy them
to the bin folder located in the Watertight.exe directory.  

Some test mods are located in the Modfiles folder.  These must go in the mods folder in the Watertight 
executable driectory.  More information on mods is located in the readme in the Modfiles folder
